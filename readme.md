# Ghengis Kahn AI Project

This repository contains two main components: a frontend application and a subgraph. The project is designed to provide a user interface for interacting with AI tokens and a subgraph for indexing and querying blockchain data.

## Repository Structure

- **Frontend**: Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), the frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the Ghengis Kahn AI platform. It includes features such as data visualization and user interaction with AI tokens.
